# sd100_final_project

Our very first github repo has been created.
This repo represents our fake website created for our last project in Intro to web development.

Robyn and I's idea was to sell water boxes. 
Also adding a subscription widget as a challenge as well as a hero banner with wave animation.

Will add more here later after it is completed.
